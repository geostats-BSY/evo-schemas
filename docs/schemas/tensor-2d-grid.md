Represents a two-dimensional tensor grid where cells may have different sizes.

The grid implements spatial properties including a coordinate reference system and bounding box in world coordinates.

The grid origin is defined in three dimensions, along with `rotation` (defined per the Rotation schema component).

The size of the grid is specified in cells (see `size`), with each cell potentially having different dimensions along the x and y axes (see `grid_cells_2d`).

Fields `cell_attributes` and `vertex_attributes` accept a variety of scalar values (see One of Attribute component), attached to either the cells (of length `grid_size_x * grid_size_y`) or vertices (of length `[grid_size_x + 1] * [grid_size_y + 1]`).
