The geophysical-records-1d object captures physical properties related to 1D geophysical records. These records are the product of geophysical inversion. These are composed of a series of 1D, vertical (columnar) datasets, each of which contains records (or dummy values) for a series of layers.

To define the geophysical-records-1d object, the following properties are required:

- The number of layers (integer; this is consistent for all records)
- An array of locations
- An array of depths
- The standard required information for a Geoscience Object

Each location entry contains information about the:

- Coordinates (x, y, z).

Each depth entry contains:

- Length values.

Additionally, the object can include:

- Line numbers.
