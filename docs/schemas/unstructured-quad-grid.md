Represents an unstructured grid where cells are quadrilaterals.

The grid implements spatial properties including a coordinate reference system and bounding box in world coordinates.

The grid's data are all stored on the `quadrilaterals` attribute, which defines the spatial layout of the grid, including the coordinates of the vertices and the connectivity between them to form quadrilateral cells.
