Represents an unstructured hexahedral grid where cells are hexahedrons.

The grid implements spatial properties including a coordinate reference system and bounding box in world coordinates.

The grid's data are all stored on the `hexahedrons` attribute, which defines the spatial layout of the grid, including the coordinates of the vertices and the connectivity between them to form hexahedral cells.
